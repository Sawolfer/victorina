The supply chain is the process of moving parts and raw materials 
from their source to factories, where they become products, and then 
to customers. 
 
In modern manufacturing, there are many suppliers providing 
different parts. Each of these suppliers may have their own suppliers 
for simpler parts or raw materials. This is called the upstream part of 
the supply chain. The downstream part includes distributors and 
customers, where goods are shipped to various locations at different 
times.

During this entire process, products need to be stored in warehouses 
and transported. A lot of information is needed to track where 
inventory is, when it will arrive, and more. This information must be 
shared among suppliers, customers, logistics providers, and 
manufacturers. Good management of this information is key to 
business success. 
 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) ensures that the right products are 
in the right place at the right time and in the right amounts. It also 
includes bigger questions like how many suppliers to have and where 
to locate production and distribution centers. It looks at how to 
improve processes and manage payments throughout the supply 
chain. 
The goal of SCM is to work with all partners to improve visibility and 
speed of inventory movement. 
Logistics involves transportation, warehousing, and inventory 
management. It can mean planning how to move materials within a 
company (internal focus) or working with suppliers and customers 
(external focus). Smaller companies may use the term 'logistics' 
instead of SCM because it sounds less complex. 
 
Logistics includes both incoming and outgoing goods and also 
"reverse logistics," where items are returned to the manufacturer. It 
involves moving goods from one transport method to another at 
places like distribution centers or warehouses.  
 
There are three main methods used in logistics: 
1. Hub-and-spoke: with this method items are sent to one central 
location and then sorted for different destinations. 
2. Consolidation: smaller shipments are combined into one larger 
shipment to save on transport costs. 
3. Deconsolidation: large shipments are split into smaller ones for 
easier delivery.
